# Included Packages
The collection currently includes the following packages:

- **[plc.Vcl.NonVisualComponents](pk_pl_vcl_nonvisualcomponents.md)**  
  A set of non‑visual components focused on **automation**, **customization**, and **state persistence**.  
  These components are designed to simplify recurring tasks and provide application‑level services with minimal configuration.

- **[plc.SE.Components](pk_pl_se_components.md)**  
  Utility components for SynEdit/SynEditor.  
  They aim to simplify common editor‑related tasks and extend SynEditor with practical, ready‑to‑use features.

- **[plc.Vcl.Db.DataControls](pk_pl_vcl_db_datacontrols.md)**  
  A collection of DB‑bound VCL controls.  
  It offers lightweight alternatives to Delphi’s LiveBindings system by relying on the native data‑binding architecture.  
  **Not yet released. Currently under development.**

- **[plc.Vcl.VisualComponents](pk_pl_vcl_visualcomponents.md)**  
  A small set of visual components that implement common UI behaviors and patterns, helping developers build consistent and maintainable interfaces.
  **Not yet released. Currently under analysis.**


# Roadmap

1. Add more components to the packages.
2. Ensure compatibility with newer versions of Delphi.
3. Improve overall documentation for better understanding.
